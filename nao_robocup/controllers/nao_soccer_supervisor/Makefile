#
# Makefile for a Webots C controller
#
# if your controller uses several C sources files:
# C_SOURCES = my_controller.c my_clever_algo.c my_gui.c
#
# if your controller needs additional libraries:
# LIBRARIES=-L/path/to/my/library -lmy_library -lmy_other_library
#
# if some special CFLAGS need to be passed, for example to find include
# files, or set optimization level:
# CFLAGS=-O3 -I/my_library_path/include
#
# finally, on Windows, if you want that your controller opens up a DOS
# console to display the printf output:
# DOS_CONSOLE=1
