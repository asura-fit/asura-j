is a Robocup category in which all the robots are the same and operate
fully autonomously, so that the competitors can

<h2>Preamble</h2>

Cyberbotics&nbsp;has developed a Webots simulation model
including&nbsp;Nao robots and a soccer field used in&nbsp;the
Standard Platform League. This model also includes a supervisor system
allowing to fully simulate a complete match of the Standard Platform
League. The model is distributed free of charge to the roboticist
community and can be used with the free demo version of Webots.
It&nbsp;allows users to develop the complete control software for the
Standard
Platform League and test it in simulation.<br>


<br>


This model is intended to the following usages:<br>


<ul>


  <li>development tool for the competitors of the Standard
Platform League.</li>


  <li>development tool for the users of the Nao robot.</li>


  <li>setup of a simulation-based competition ressembling the
Standard Platform League: see details at <a href="http://www.robotstadium.org">http://www.robotstadium.org</a></li>


</ul>


<h2>Robot Model</h2>


The current version of the robot model includes the simulation of the
following devices:<br>


<ul>


  <li>22 servo motors with position control, speed control, force
control, position feedback and force feedback.</li>


  <li>1 color LED in the logo displayed on the body of the robot.</li>


  <li>1 color camera with a resolution of 160x120 pixel and a
horizontal field of view of 45 degrees.</li>


  <li>2 ultrasound distance sensors with a range of 70 cm.</li>


  <li>1 3D accelerometer in the body of the robot.</li>


  <li>8 pressure sensors (4 below each of the two feet of
the robot).</li>


  <li><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"><blink></blink></span>
1&nbsp;emitter device allowing the robots to send messages to their teammates.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>

  <li>1 receiver device allowing the robots to receive messages from their their teammates.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"><blink></blink></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"><blink></blink></span></li>

</ul>

<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"></span>
<ul>


</ul>


<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>: removing the pressure sensors makes the physics simulation run twice as fast.<br>

<h2>Programming Languages</h2>


The Nao robot can be programmed using the following different
programming languages:<br>


<ul>
  <li>URBI: a sample URBI program is provided in the nao_soccer_player_blue controller.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"><blink></blink></span></li>


  <li>Java: a sample Java program is provided in the nao_soccer_player_red controller.</li>

  <li>C/C++: a sample program is provided along with the Java sample, but is not allowed for the robotstadium competition.</li>
  <li>Any third party program (Matlab, LabView, Lisp, etc.)
through a TCP/IP connection, but it is not allowed for the robotstadium competition.</li>


</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

A physics simulation of two teams of 4 Nao robots (i.e., 8 robots)
including intensive OpenGL camera usage (8 robot cameras and 1 main
viewpoint camera) is a computer expensive process. Hence a powerful
computer is highly recommended to run this simulation. We recommend the
following hardware configuration:<br>

<ul>

  <li>an Intel Core 2 Quad, AMD64 X4 or better processor.</li>

  <li>a recent nVidia or ATI graphics card with at least 256MB of RAM.</li>

</ul>

Since Webots runs on multiple platforms, you can choose either of these operating systems:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Linux 32 or 64 bit (any recent distribution)</li>

  <li>Windows XP or Vista</li>

  <li>Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5</li>

</ul>

<h2>Support</h2>

This simulation model is provided on a as is basis. Neither Robocup,
Aldebaran Robotics, Cyberbotics or Gostai responsible for providing
user support on this model unless a support agreement has been entered
between the user and the interested company.<br>

Users can nevertheless use online forums hosted by Robocup, Aldebaran Robotics, Cyberbotics and Gostai to help each other.
